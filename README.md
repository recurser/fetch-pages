## Notes

- I use the [httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) in Ruby to simplify fetching, automatically follow redirects etc.


## Questions

- The example only showed top-level domains being fetched. How should the file naming behave if a subfolder or sub-page is fetched? I've opted to use the file or folder name in that case.
